Working and Parenting during COVID-19: A U.S. Census Analysis

The Project
The purpose of this project is to shed light on the challenges that working parents are facing during the 2020-2021 COVID-19 pandemic. My analysis of U.S. Census Household Pulse Survey data reveals that in 2020 Californiaâ€™s job market lost the most parents with schoolchildren in the country, trailing only Nevada and Michigan. In 2020, California households with PreK-12 children were significantly more likely to lose employment income than parents without children.
