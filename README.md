# Working and Parenting during COVID-19

## The Project
The purpose of this project is to shed light on the challenges that working parents are facing during the 2020-2021 COVID-19 pandemic. My analysis of U.S. Census Household Pulse Survey data reveals that in 2020 Californiaâ€™s job market lost the most parents with schoolchildren in the country, trailing only Nevada and Michigan. In 2020, California households with PreK-12 children were significantly more likely to lose employment income than parents without children.

## The Data
I downloaded the data for weeks 1 through 25 of the pandemic from the U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey Public Use files (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/datasets.html). Each week's data is published in a separate csv file. The Census also publishes weekly data dictionaries in excel format.

## The Analysis
I conducted my analysis in Python. The code can be found here.
